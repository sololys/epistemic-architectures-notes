# Contributing (Canonical Reference)

Thank you for your interest in the **Epistemic Architectures** canonical repository.

This repository contains stabilized, governed, and authoritative reference material.
It is not an open working space.

Contributions are therefore highly constrained.

---

## Canonical Status

This repository is **canonical**.

Content here defines:
- normative architectural structure,
- stabilized epistemic concepts,
- authoritative reference material.

All material is subject to editorial control.

---

## Contribution Policy

Direct contributions are **not accepted by default**.

Changes to this repository occur only through:
- explicit editorial invitation, or
- formal promotion from a non-canonical repository.

Pull requests submitted without prior coordination
may be closed without review.

---

## Promotion from Non-Canonical Repositories

Concepts may be considered for promotion only if they are:
- stable across multiple iterations,
- internally consistent,
- non-reconstructive with respect to implementation,
- aligned with the existing canonical architecture.

Promotion is a deliberate act.
It does not occur automatically through contribution.

---

## What This Repository Does *Not* Accept

This repository does not accept:
- exploratory drafts,
- speculative extensions,
- alternative framings under active debate,
- implementation logic or operational detail,
- experimental or provisional material.

Such content belongs in non-canonical repositories.

---

## Editorial Control

All accepted changes are:
- reviewed for epistemic safety,
- evaluated for boundary preservation,
- integrated only if they strengthen canonical coherence.

The absence of change is an acceptable and often preferred outcome.

---

## Final Note

The purpose of this repository is stability, not growth.

If you wish to contribute ideas, analysis, or alternatives,
please do so in a non-canonical working repository.

Canonical material changes rarely and deliberately.
