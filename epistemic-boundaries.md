# Epistemic Boundaries (Exploratory)

What does a system know?

What does it *know that it knows*?

What must remain unknowable by design?

This note is exploratory.

It examines boundaries between:
- state
- confidence
- meta-awareness
- governance intervention

The goal is not to answer these questions fully,
but to mark where answers become unsafe.
