# Epistemic Boundaries (Exploratory)

This note examines epistemic boundaries as structural constraints on knowledge,
awareness, and intervention.

It does not define mechanisms, thresholds, or implementations.
It is non-canonical and non-operational.

---

## Framing Questions

What can a system know?

What can it know *about its own knowing*?

What must remain unknowable by design?

These questions are not posed in order to be resolved,
but to delineate the limits within which epistemic activity remains safe.

---

## Boundary Domains

This note considers boundaries between the following domains:

- state, as represented or inferred,
- confidence, as an internal assessment of epistemic reliability,
- meta-awareness, as reflection on epistemic condition,
- governance, as a constraint on epistemic and operational action.

These domains are analytically distinct but intentionally not fully separable.

---

## Boundary Function

Epistemic boundaries serve to:
- prevent collapse between representation and reality,
- limit recursive self-reference,
- constrain premature or unsafe concretization,
- preserve the distinction between observation, interpretation, and action.

Boundaries are not errors or limitations to be optimized away.
They are structural safety conditions.

## Withheld Structure

Not all epistemic machinery is suitable for public inspection.

Some components require:
- contextual grounding,
- governance oversight,
- or intentional restraint.

This withholding is not a matter of secrecy,
but of epistemic safety and misuse prevention.

---

## Open Questions

Where a boundary is drawn is not fully decidable in advance.

Attempts to exhaustively specify all epistemic transitions
risk erasing the very conditions that make boundary enforcement meaningful.

Partial opacity is therefore intentional.

## Status

This note is exploratory.
It is descriptive, not normative.
It does not specify implementation, execution order, or decision logic.
