# How to Read the Epistemic Architectures Ecosystem

The **Epistemic Architectures** project is organized as an ecosystem of repositories
with clearly separated epistemic roles.

Understanding this separation is essential for correct interpretation.

---

## Canonical vs. Non-Canonical

The ecosystem distinguishes between:

### Canonical Repositories
Canonical repositories contain:
- stabilized definitions,
- normative architectural structure,
- authoritative reference material.

They are governed, versioned, and intentionally slow to change.

Canonical material should be cited, not extended.

---

### Non-Canonical Repositories
Non-canonical repositories function as working spaces.

They may contain:
- exploratory notes,
- sketches and partial formulations,
- alternative framings,
- unresolved questions or examples.

Material in non-canonical repositories:
- may be incomplete or contradictory,
- carries no authoritative status,
- is not suitable for implementation.

---

## Notes Repositories

Notes repositories are intentionally open-ended.

They support:
- epistemic exploration,
- architectural reasoning,
- boundary testing.

They do not define system behavior.

Absence, ambiguity, and fragmentation may be intentional.

---

## Promotion Path

Concepts do not become canonical by accumulation.

Promotion occurs only through:
- deliberate editorial review,
- stabilization over time,
- explicit inclusion in the canonical reference.

Until promoted, material remains provisional.

---

## Reading Guidance

When reading this ecosystem:
- treat canonical repositories as reference,
- treat notes repositories as thought space,
- do not infer implementation from description,
- do not assume completeness from clarity.

The architecture prioritizes epistemic safety
over procedural convenience.

---

## Final Principle

The ecosystem is designed for **inspection without reconstruction**.

Understanding is encouraged.
Operational inference is not.
