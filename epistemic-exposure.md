# Epistemic Exposure (Exploratory)

This note examines epistemic exposure as a design constraint.
It concerns what may be referenced, described, or discussed in public-facing
architectural material without enabling reconstruction or misuse.

This document is non-canonical and non-operational.

---

## Framing

Not all epistemic machinery is suitable for public inspection.

Exposure is not a default state.
It is an intentional design decision governed by epistemic safety,
context sensitivity, and responsibility.

This note describes exposure boundaries, not disclosure rules.

---

## Exposure Domains

For the purposes of this note, exposure is considered across
distinct but related domains:

- conceptual exposure, concerning ideas, abstractions, and interpretive frames,
- structural exposure, concerning roles, relationships, and constraints,
- operational exposure, concerning mechanisms, thresholds, triggers,
  and irreversible transitions.

Only the first two are assumed safe for unrestricted public discussion.

---

## Restricted Scope

Certain epistemic domains may require governance, contextual grounding,
or intentional restraint prior to exposure.

These include, but are not limited to:
- irreversible decision structures,
- conditions for intervention or override,
- amplification pathways and feedback coupling,
- system elements whose effects cannot be meaningfully reversed.

This restriction reflects epistemic responsibility,
not secrecy or concealment.

---

## Rationale

Unconstrained exposure may:
- create false confidence regarding system behavior,
- enable misuse outside intended context,
- collapse epistemic boundaries between description and execution,
- shift accountability without corresponding governance.

Restraint therefore functions as an epistemic safety feature,
not a limitation to be optimized away.

---

## Boundary Condition

Exposure policies cannot be exhaustively specified in advance.

Attempts to fully enumerate what may be exposed
risk eliminating the contextual judgment
that makes epistemic restraint effective.

Partial opacity is intentional.

---

## Status

This note is exploratory.
It is descriptive, not normative.
It specifies no mechanisms, thresholds, or operational criteria.

Any stabilized exposure policy must be promoted explicitly
to the canonical reference repository.
