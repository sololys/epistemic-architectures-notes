# Epistemic Exposure (Exploratory)

This note defines principles for what may be exposed, referenced, or discussed
in public-facing epistemic architectures.

It does **not** describe mechanisms, implementations, or operational details.

---

## Guiding Principle

Not all epistemic machinery is suitable for public inspection.

Exposure is a design decision, not a default.

---

## Layers of Exposure

We distinguish between:

- **Conceptual exposure**  
  High-level ideas, abstractions, and philosophical structure.

- **Structural exposure**  
  Relationships between concepts, roles, and constraints.

- **Operational exposure**  
  Mechanisms, thresholds, triggers, and irreversible transitions.

Only the first two are assumed public by default.

---

## Restricted Domains

The following domains may require explicit governance, context, or restraint
before exposure:

- irreversible decision logic
- intervention thresholds
- supervisory override conditions
- feedback amplification mechanisms
- RF-linked control or signaling modules

Restriction does not imply secrecy, but responsibility.

---

## Rationale

Premature exposure can:

- create false confidence
- enable misuse outside intended context
- collapse epistemic boundaries
- shift accountability without governance

Therefore, restraint is an epistemic safety feature.

---

## Status

This note is exploratory.

If stabilized, exposure policy must be promoted explicitly
to the canonical reference repository.
