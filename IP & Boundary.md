Purpose

This repository exposes architectural form and epistemic structure, not operational capability.
Its function is epistemic: to support inspection, discussion, and exploratory reasoning without enabling reconstruction, deployment, or irreversible action.

Canonical Separation

All normative definitions, deterministic decision logic, and irreversible control and decision structures reside exclusively in the canonical reference repository.

This repository is explicitly non-canonical.

No material here should be interpreted as:

sufficient for implementation

complete in dependency structure

authoritative for operational use

Epistemic Withholding

These boundaries are necessary to prevent premature or unsafe concretization.

Some conceptual gaps, omissions, and abstractions are intentional.

They function as:

epistemic safety boundaries

misuse-prevention mechanisms

protection against false operational inference

Absence is treated as a design element, not an oversight.

Exposure Constraint

Public inspection does not imply:

operational completeness

reconstructive sufficiency

permission to derive end-to-end behavior

Readable form ≠ executable knowledge.

Fail-Closed Interpretation

In cases of ambiguity, uncertainty, or apparent incompleteness, the correct interpretation is non-action.

Silence, refusal, or lack of instruction is a valid and intended epistemic outcome.

Status

This repository may change, fragment, or be reorganized without notice.
Stability, guarantees, and authoritative references exist only in the canonical source
