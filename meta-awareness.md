# Meta-Awareness (Exploratory)
This document describes epistemic form, not operational capability.


This note examines meta-awareness as an epistemic constraint.
It concerns a system’s capacity to relate to its own knowledge without
collapsing reflection into control.

This document is non-canonical and non-operational.

## Framing

Meta-awareness is not knowledge about the world,
but awareness of the conditions under which knowledge claims remain valid.

It does not answer what a system knows,
but limits what a system may justifiably act upon.

---

## Epistemic Position

Meta-awareness operates above:
- state, as represented or inferred,
- confidence, as an assessment of epistemic reliability.

It is not a belief, model, or prediction.
It functions as a constraint on belief formation and action commitment.

---

## Indicative Phenomena (Non-Enumerative)

Meta-awareness may be suggested by unresolved signals indicating
tension between a system’s representations and their continued validity.

Such indications are indirect, context-dependent, and fragile.
They do not constitute proof, triggers, or decision rules.

No exhaustive set of indicators is defined here.

---

## Failure Tendencies

Absence or collapse of meta-awareness may manifest as:
- confusion between internal coherence and external validity,
- inability to distinguish ignorance from uncertainty,
- overextension of confidence beyond epistemic support,
- delayed recognition of invalid assumptions.

These tendencies are descriptive, not diagnostic.

## Relationship to Governance

Meta-awareness constrains the legitimacy of governance consideration,
but does not authorize intervention.

Governance without meta-awareness risks reactive enforcement.
Meta-awareness without governance risks epistemic inertia.

No procedural coupling is specified.

---

## Boundary Condition

Meta-awareness must remain partial.

A system that claims full knowledge of its own knowing
has already crossed an epistemic boundary.

The aim is not self-certainty,
but sustained epistemic humility.

## Status

This note is exploratory.
It is descriptive, not normative.
It specifies no mechanisms, thresholds, or execution logic.
