# Meta-Awareness (Exploratory)

What does a system know about its own knowing?

Meta-awareness concerns the system’s capacity to:
- recognize limits of its models
- detect when assumptions no longer hold
- distinguish ignorance from uncertainty
- avoid mistaking internal coherence for external validity

This note is exploratory.

It does not attempt to solve meta-awareness,
but to mark where its *absence* becomes dangerous.

## Scope

Meta-awareness operates above:
- state (what is)
- confidence (how reliable it seems)

It is not a belief, but a *constraint on belief formation*.

---

## Signals of Meta-Awareness

A system may exhibit meta-awareness through:
- explicit model validity bounds
- detection of distributional shift
- monitoring epistemic drift
- recognition of blind spots
- escalation when confidence exceeds justification

These signals are indirect and often fragile.

## Failure Modes

Common failure modes include:
- **False self-knowledge**  
  The system believes it understands its own limits, but does not.
- **Confidence collapse masking ignorance**  
  Low confidence interpreted as safety rather than uncertainty.
- **Narrative coherence bias**  
  Internally consistent explanations mistaken for truth.
- **Silent overreach**  
  Acting beyond epistemic authority without triggering intervention.

## Relationship to Governance

Meta-awareness is a *precondition* for legitimate governance intervention.

Without it:
- overrides are delayed
- risks are normalized
- escalation thresholds drift

Governance without meta-awareness becomes reactive.
Meta-awareness without governance becomes inert.

---

## Boundary Condition

Meta-awareness must remain partial.

A system that claims full knowledge of its own knowing
has already crossed an epistemic boundary.

The goal is not self-certainty,
but sustained epistemic humility.
