# Governance (Exploratory)

This note explores when and how governance logic may intervene in an epistemic system.

The focus is not on authority, but on *conditions for intervention*.

---

## Core Questions

- When is intervention justified?
- Who (or what) is allowed to intervene?
- What epistemic signals trigger intervention?
- Is the intervention reversible?
- How is intervention distinguished from correction or override?

---

## Intervention Triggers

Possible triggers include:

- loss of epistemic confidence
- detection of distributional shift
- internal inconsistency across models
- violation of safety or boundary constraints
- divergence between state and confidence signals

---

## Levels of Governance

We distinguish between:

1. **Internal governance**  
   Self-regulation mechanisms embedded in the system.

2. **Supervisory governance**  
   External logic monitoring epistemic health and stability.

3. **Hard intervention**  
   Forced constraint, shutdown, or override.

Each level carries increasing epistemic and ethical cost.

---

## Key Risks

- Premature intervention that suppresses learning
- Delayed intervention that allows epistemic drift
- Treating governance as truth rather than constraint
- Irreversible actions without epistemic justification

---

## Open Boundary

Governance must remain partially undecidable.

A system that fully specifies all interventions
risks eliminating the conditions under which
governance is actually needed.

This note is exploratory.
