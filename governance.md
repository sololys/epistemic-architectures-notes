# Governance (Exploratory)

This note examines governance as an epistemic boundary function.
It describes conditions of consideration, not authority, execution, or control logic.

This document is non-canonical and non-operational.

## Governance Tensions

Governance involves inherent tensions, including:
- preserving learning capacity while preventing epistemic drift,
- avoiding premature constraint without tolerating unchecked divergence,
- maintaining governance as a boundary condition rather than a truth source.

These tensions are structural, not algorithmic.
They describe tradeoffs, not decision rules.

## Core Questions (Exploratory, Non-Operational)

The following questions are intentionally left open.
They do not define triggers, authority, thresholds, or execution logic.

- Under what conditions might governance become relevant?
- What distinctions exist between intervention, correction, and constraint?
- How can epistemic uncertainty be recognized without being prematurely resolved?
- What differentiates reversible adjustment from irreversible intervention?

No answers are specified here.

## Intervention Consideration (Non-Enumerative)

Governance consideration arises only under conditions of epistemic instability.

Such conditions may be indicated by unresolved signals suggesting:
- degradation of epistemic integrity,
- misalignment between observation and internal representation,
- sustained boundary or constraint tension,
- or prolonged uncertainty regarding system self-consistency.

No exhaustive trigger set is defined.
No mapping from signal to action is implied.

## Governance Modalities (Non-Sequential)

Governance may manifest through different modalities, including:
- internal self-regulation mechanisms,
- supervisory oversight functions,
- externally enforced constraints.

These modalities are not presented as a sequence or escalation path.
Their applicability is context-dependent and not specified here.

## Open Boundary

Governance must remain partially undecidable.

A system that fully specifies all interventions risks eliminating the very conditions
under which governance is actually needed.

This partial undecidability is intentional and functions as an epistemic safety boundary.

## Status

This note is exploratory.
It is descriptive, not normative.
It does not specify implementation, execution order, or decision logic.
