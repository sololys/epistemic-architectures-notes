# Irreversibility (Exploratory)

## 1. Definition
An irreversible action is an action whose epistemic or physical consequences
cannot be fully undone without loss, distortion, or external intervention.

## 2. Classes of Irreversibility
- Physical (energy, matter, harm)
- Informational (deletion, overwrite, commitment)
- Epistemic (belief lock-in, authority assertion)
- Social / governance (mandates, sanctions, escalation)

## 3. False Reversibility
Cases where systems *appear* reversible but are not:
- rollbacks without context restoration
- explanations after commitment
- confidence reduction after action

## 4. Preconditions for Irreversible Action
Minimum epistemic requirements:
- state certainty thresholds
- confidence bounds
- meta-awareness confirmation
- explicit governance authorization

## 5. The No-Undo Rule
Actions beyond this boundary must:
- be logged
- be attributable
- require asymmetric justification

## 6. Failure Mode
The primary failure is not wrong action,
but *irreversible action under epistemic uncertainty*.
