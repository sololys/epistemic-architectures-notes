# Notes Index

This directory contains exploratory notes related to the
**Epistemic Architectures** project.

Nothing here is canonical.
Fragments may contradict each other.
Stability lives upstream.

---

## Purpose

This space is intended for:
- exploratory thinking,
- architectural sketches,
- partial or provisional formulations,
- examples and edge cases,
- future drafts.

Material in this directory may be incomplete, inconsistent,
or deliberately unresolved.

## Canonical Relationship

If a concept stabilizes, it must be promoted explicitly
to the canonical repository.

Until then, no content here should be treated as authoritative,
complete, or suitable for implementation.
