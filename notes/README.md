# Notes Index

This directory contains exploratory notes related to the *Epistemic Architectures* project.

Nothing here is canonical.
Fragments may contradict each other.
Stability lives upstream.

Use this space for:
- exploratory thinking
- architectural sketches
- partial formulations
- examples and edge cases
- future drafts

If a concept stabilizes, it should be promoted to the canonical repository.
