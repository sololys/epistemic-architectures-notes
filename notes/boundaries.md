# Epistemic Boundaries

What does the system know?
What does it *know that it knows*?
What must remain unknowable?



This note explores boundaries between:
- state
- confidence
- meta-awareness
- governance intervention
## Boundary Layers

We distinguish between several epistemic layers:

### 1. State
What the system *is* right now.
Observable variables, internal representations, and measured signals.

Key risk:
- Confusing state with certainty.

---

### 2. Confidence
What the system believes about the reliability of its state.

Confidence may be:
- explicit (probabilities, bounds)
- implicit (control gains, thresholds)

Key risk:
-Treating confidence as truth rather than as a control signal.
---

### 3. Meta-awareness
What the system knows about its own knowing.

Examples:
- awareness of model limits
- detection of distributional shift
- recognition of epistemic blind spots

Key risk:
- False meta-awareness (the illusion of self-knowledge).

---

### 4. Governance Intervention
When and how external or supervisory logic may intervene.

Questions:
- Who is allowed to override?
- Under what epistemic conditions?
- Is intervention reversible?

Key risk:
- Intervention without epistemic justification.
- ---

## Invariant

Confidence must never collapse into certainty.  
Meta-awareness must never claim completeness.  
Governance must never intervene without epistemic justification.
